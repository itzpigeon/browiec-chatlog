2025-10-06 21:49 browiec: hi, wanted to ask about sth regarding ur puppet map
2025-10-06 21:49 browiec: firstly whether 05:31:421 (1) snapping is intentional
2025-10-06 21:50 browiec: secondly whether youd consider 04:20:087 (5,6,7,8) - etc making these wobbly bursts straight lines or just curves, they seem pretty random and they firetruck up reading so much
2025-10-06 21:51 Liliana: snapping at 05:31:421 (1) -  was absolutely not intentional 
2025-10-06 21:53 Liliana:  I originally had the wobbles as accelerating bursts either curved or straight. I switched to having variations of wobbles, curved, and straight instead because I thought it gave those patterns a little extra oomph
2025-10-06 21:53 Liliana: I can change it back to being only curves and straight bursts if you think it's too much
2025-10-06 21:53 browiec: id go back to curves/straight for playability's sake
2025-10-06 21:54 Liliana: roger that
2025-10-06 21:55 browiec: theyre objectively fine but ye i think its beneficial for the map not to do these in like 5th minute after the entire map being pretty predictable rhythm n pattern wise
2025-10-06 21:55 browiec: at least they threw me off p badly and i should be able to easily play 5.5* so ye
2025-10-06 21:56 Liliana: 04:36:087 (5,6,7,8) - here and 04:41:421 (5,6,7,8) - here and 04:57:421 (5,6,7,8) - here as well too I assume?
2025-10-06 21:56 browiec: sorry if thats style infringement on my end but ye
2025-10-06 21:56 browiec: yeye i meant all the wobbly ones in the chorus
2025-10-06 21:57 Liliana: honestly I totally understand. I do like how they look personally, but for playability I can change them absolutely
2025-10-06 21:57 browiec: i closed client and i dont remember if you did the same thing in the 2nd chorus as well
2025-10-06 21:57 browiec: but id change that as well if its present too
2025-10-06 21:58 browiec: ty for understanding, ive had this song in my playlist p much since it came out and saw the map in pending
2025-10-06 21:58 browiec: so i thought better to let u know about what i think before it hits qualified not to create any inconveniences for you and the bns
2025-10-06 21:58 Liliana: these are all timestamps from the first kiai before the break. I only do it one more time to close out the second kiai section with a sliderstream
2025-10-06 21:59 Liliana: that's actually insane timing, because I was just talking to passionate about having it be finalized not even 20 minutes ago lol
2025-10-06 21:59 Liliana: hopefully I did the songs justice 
2025-10-06 21:59 browiec: i tried mapping it myself years ago but never finished so its nice seeing it mapped in a rankable way
2025-10-06 22:00 browiec: and ye i check pending frequently because i dont rly get bn reqs myself
2025-10-06 22:00 browiec: so i often look for maps on my own
2025-10-06 22:01 Liliana: HOPEFULLY it will be qualified within a week. Kauan did have some personal stuff come up after accepting to be my second bn about 3 months back and only just got around to modding it this past weekend
2025-10-06 22:02 browiec: kinda funny coincidence how 2 bns with no ranked maps helped you get your first
2025-10-06 22:04 Liliana: actually crazy isn't it. I knew passionate before he became bn, and had sent him the map a few months back just to share my work with a friend, not knowing he was a bn now. 
2025-10-06 22:07 browiec: i dont keep up with the community at all so when new bns get added i usually get to know that when i get my 1 or 2 weekly bn requests and the mapper tells me whos their 1st bn
2025-10-06 22:07 browiec: and im like
2025-10-06 22:07 browiec: who again
2025-10-06 22:08 Liliana: LOL 
2025-10-06 22:08 Liliana: I've never ranked anything before, I honestly didn't even feel like what I had made for this map was even that special, let alone good enough to be rankable
2025-10-06 22:12 browiec: maps dont need to be special in order to be rankable
2025-10-06 22:12 browiec: (speaking from experience lol)
2025-10-06 22:14 Liliana: would you by any chance be willing to make a mod about the wobbles at some point so I can have something to show as to why I change them?
2025-10-06 22:15 browiec: just screenshot our conversation
2025-10-06 22:15 Liliana: oh that's fair alright
2025-10-06 22:16 browiec: i dont rly like posting on modding discussions because nowadays it feels like whatever subjective thing you post youll get nuked for it by someone and i dont have the time and patience for that
2025-10-06 22:16 browiec: when i mod i always post only the important stuff and talk with the mapper directly about subjective things
2025-10-06 22:16 Liliana: I see
